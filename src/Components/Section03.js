        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>My name is Brandon Griggs! I graduated from Grand Valley State University with a bachelors degree in computer science. 
            I have a lot of general knowledge and skills in the field. I've have experience coding in many languages and on many platforms.
            Including languages such as c, c++, c#, java, python, R, javascript, html, css, SQL, mySQL and platforms such as Unity, and Android Studio.
            However, a lot of the that knowledge is introductory and lacks the depth I would like. To Remedy this, I've taken focus at web development specifically with
            an aim of taking my javascript, css, and html to the next level while Leverageing React to create unique custom front ends. I have picked each
            project with a different goal in expanding my knowledge of web development. Projects range from a simple stylized search bar to a full stack login system.
            In future projects I hope to impliment a css preprocessor such as Sass, as well as expand on my knowledge of Node.js and Next.js in building full stack 
            applications compatable with SQL databases.
